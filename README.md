# Resume_CSS
Resume and Cover Letter written in HTML/CSS

Background: I normally prepare my documents in LaTeX, however, writing style and class files require a lot of patience. I needed something quick and decided to give it a try to HTML/CSS, and this has become my first HTML/CSS project. 

You can change and use it as you wish.
